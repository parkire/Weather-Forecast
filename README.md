In recent years, small-scale potato farmers in Nakuru, Narok, and Nyandarua have faced significant challenges due to increasing uncertainties in weather patterns. These counties, located in Kenya’s Rift Valley region, are known for their fertile soils and favorable climates for potato cultivation, making them key contributors to the country’s potato production. However, shifting weather conditions—driven by factors such as climate change—have disrupted traditional farming cycles. Erratic rainfall, prolonged droughts, and unexpected temperature fluctuations have led to reduced crop yields, with farmers often planting too early or too late to capitalize on optimal conditions. These irregular weather patterns have resulted in substantial losses, including low crop production that fails to meet both household needs and market demands. For instance, delayed rains can stunt potato growth, while excessive rainfall can cause waterlogging and rot, diminishing harvest quality. Beyond the farm, these disruptions ripple through local economies: unpredictable supply affects market prices, reduces farmer incomes, and creates instability in potato-dependent food systems. Compounding the issue, many small-scale farmers lack access to timely, localized weather information, leaving them reliant on traditional knowledge that is increasingly misaligned with current climate realities. This project emerges as a response to these challenges, aiming to bridge the information gap with a data-driven forecasting tool. By leveraging historical weather data and modern forecasting techniques, the model seeks to empower farmers with actionable insights, enabling them to adapt to changing conditions, optimize their planting schedules, and mitigate losses. The focus on Nakuru, Narok, and Nyandarua reflects their agricultural significance and the urgent need to support their potato farming communities amid growing climate uncertainty.
